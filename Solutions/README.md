# Solution

three algorithms are present, uncluding bubble, merge and insertion sorts. They are imported into `result.js` file, where the solution is demonstrated: example array, logging the result of all sorting algorhithms

```
[
  11, 12, 22, 25,
  34, 64, 90
]
[
  11, 12, 22, 25,
  34, 64, 90
]
[
  11, 12, 22, 25,
  34, 64, 90
]
```

So since it is the same and it is sorted, all three algorhithms are correctly sorts and are working
