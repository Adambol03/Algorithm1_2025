# Algorithms I; Class 2025

### Programming Languages
Students are encouraged to experiment with multiple languages and paradigms: object, oriented, functional, old, ... languages.


### LLMs
It is hard to prevent usage of LLMs by students. 
Rather, we find more useful to build with the students our own LLM that is specialised in writing correct and efficient algorithms. 

We recommend for this tiny LLMs that can be downloaded from Huggingface: 
```OpenMachineAI/Gena1-OM-7Mil-Base```
